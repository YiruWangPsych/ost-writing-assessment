The most valuable experience I had in my college life is taking a course on women and gender in Buddhism. Not only I learned many knowledge in Buddhism, such as empathy, mindfulness practice, and how are those practiced in various classes of Buddhist around the globe. I also learned and was introduced to gender study. I found out that though Buddhism, by definition, promotes equality and equity among all the lives, many practices claim that men are easier to reach nirvana than women. There are also some power dynamics between the practitioners. 
I found this class valuable is that it is a really open-minded experience, like I was introduced to the world again, and examine the world around us in another angle.
