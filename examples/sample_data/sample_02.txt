I have been fortunate to have had many valuable experiences in college thus far, but one that I will remember most is my time at a Christian fellowship group on campus. I grew up in a Christian family, but it wasn't until my senior year of high school that I realized that I could have a relationship with God if I simply asked, and I became a Christian myself. My time at this fellowship was valuable because it was my first time being in a Christian community of peers. It is so good to have friends who pray for you and others, help you grow in faith, study the Bible together, and share their own experiences.
