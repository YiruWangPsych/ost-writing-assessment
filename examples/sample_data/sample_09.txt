One of the most valuable experiences I have had throughout my college time is when I had to write my first essay for my first-year seminar class. It was also my very first essay in college so I was extremely nervous about how to approach the prompt and how to explain my idea properly. As soon as I received the prompt, I spent three hours every day to read books and flesh out my ideas. One of the most helpful resources on campus is the writing center and it was my writing mentor who guided me through my first writing process, from brainstorming to completing the final draft.
