A valuable experience I have had during my college career was taking a graph theory course offered my sophomore year. It was valuable for many reasons, both socially and academically.
First, I made a few great friends who I am still in touch with today. Additionally, I got to know the professor and came to love her style of teaching. Combined with my realization of interest in the topic, this prompted me to take many more graph theory courses with her in the future. I have been able to continue to learn about the subject as well as have access to research opportunities since taking that class.
My college experience would have been significantly different and less enriching and enjoyable without this valuable experience of taking graph theory.
