Auditioning for and joining the college symphony orchestra is a valuable experience that I have had during my time here. I was hesitant to join because of the competitive, toxic orchestra culture back home but I am so glad that I joined because this orchestra has brought back my love for playing in an orchestral setting. I am now one of the concertmasters and a section leader. Taking on a leadership role has taught me a lot and has encouraged me to step out of my comfort zone.
