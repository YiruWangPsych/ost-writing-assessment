During my very first semester, for my very first college essay, I thought that I was going to fail. For a week I had been staring at an empty word document trying desperately to turn all the thoughts in my head into a proper essay. I knew exactly what I wanted to say, what arguments I wanted to make, but it seemed impossible to get it on paper. At last a friend gave me advice. She said: how about you tell someone what you plan to write, record it and then transcribe that. I did so, and explaining my thoughts aloud was enjoyable and helped me overcome my writer's block.
