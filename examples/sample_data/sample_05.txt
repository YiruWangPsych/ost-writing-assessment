This is my first year of college career and what did I learn? So far I am doing fairly well in my classes and gotten into clubs for officer positions but through these experiences, I have learned that time management with the will of self control is important to the point that it is essential for an independent and healthy lifestyle.
Although I may be a hypocrite to my words, I am still trying to figure out how I could manage my time on my own to have studying, clubs, and sleep balanced. Living at home where there is a set system and strict rules, it is comforting yet a little suffocating. I've gone to realize that independence means that you will be affected by the consequences more directly in college such as getting enough sleep for the next day.
Though I find the benefits of independence rewarding, the responsibility can be overwhelming at times.
