A valuable experience that I've had in college has been finding and experiencing my spiritual awakening. As a Muslim woman I struggled at first in college navigating my space and learning and relearning Islam as the way I saw most fitting to me. College was already a very hard experience, however, that coupled with being away from a godly community, I really had a hard time not only navigating God but also navigating what God meant to me outside of the punitive nature in which I learned God at home. I was feeling this way until my sophomore year of college whenever I went to one of my first Muslim student association events. Through that organization, I was able to not only find community, but I also developed fruitful bonds and learned freely through finding faith on my own terms.
