I am currently in a second-level Italian class, having taken introductory courses while still on the module schedule last year. I have never previously spoken Italian, and took the class in order to learn. It has proven valuable as my listening comprehension has increased significantly, although I still have trouble with forming sentences due to being unable to remember English to Italian translations. Nonetheless, as my Italian to English vocabulary expands, so does the former, allowing me to progress in my language learning. Even though Italian is not a widely spoken language outside of Italy, I believe that the process of learning a new language is the most important part, not the differences between the language learned. I choose Italian because of my interest in the culture and history.
