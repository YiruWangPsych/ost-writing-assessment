An important experience I've had is in-person socialization with my peers. In the 2020-2021 school year, which was entirely virtual for me, I didn't really feel like I was actually in college. Moving onto campus and being able to interact with my peers face to face in a classroom setting and outside of it has shaped my college experience so far. It's proven that children require socialization, especially in early to late childhood, to properly develop. I think this is still extremely applicable later in life as well, though. Humans are social creatures, and as such need interactions with other people.
